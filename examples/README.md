## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPEN_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Install CVInsight (if not already installed)
pip install -e /path/to/CVInsight
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from cvinsight.notebook_utils import initialize_client, parse_single_resume

# Initialize
client = initialize_client("your-api-key")

# Parse a resume with job context
result = parse_single_resume(
    client=client,
    resume_path="path/to/resume.pdf",
    date_of_resume_submission="2025-05-29",
    job_description="Your job description here"
)
```

## üéØ Key Features Demonstrated

### Performance Optimization
- **75% faster processing** with unified extractor
- **Single API call** for comprehensive analysis
- **21 structured fields** extracted efficiently

### Job-Specific Analysis
- **Dynamic relevance scoring** based on job requirements
- **Context-aware experience evaluation**
- **Education relevance assessment**

### Production Features
- **Error handling and recovery**
- **Parallel processing capabilities**
- **Comprehensive logging and monitoring**

The CVInsight notebook utilities provide the following functions:

- `initialize_client(api_key, provider, model_name)` - Initialize the CVInsight client with all plugins
- `parse_single_resume(client, resume_path, date_of_resume_submission, job_description)` - Parse a single resume and return the extracted information
- `parse_many_resumes(client, resume_paths, date_of_resume_submission, job_description, use_tqdm, parallel, max_workers)` - Parse multiple resumes with optional parallel processing
- `find_resumes(directory_path)` - Find all resume files in a directory

## Integration Tips

When integrating CVInsight into your own projects:

1. Ensure the CVInsight repository is in your Python path
2. Use the `initialize_client()` function for consistent setup with all plugins
3. For large batches of resumes, enable parallel processing with `parse_many_resumes(parallel=True)`
4. Handle errors gracefully by checking the `parsing_status` field in the results

## Further Customization

You can customize the parsing behavior by:

1. Selecting specific LLM providers and models
2. Using parallel processing for large datasets
3. Implementing custom post-processing of the DataFrame results

For more details on customization options, see the [CVInsight documentation](../../README.md).
