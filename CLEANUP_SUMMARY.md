# CVInsight Repository Cleanup

This document summarizes the cleanup changes made to the CVInsight repository.

## Changes Made

### 1. README Consolidation
- Merged README_CHANGES.md content into README.md
- Simplified feature list
- Added usage instructions
- Added performance metrics from latest run

### 2. Script Simplification
- Created a new streamlined script (`run_resumes.py`) to replace `run_all_resumes.py`
- Removed unnecessary performance metrics collection
- Eliminated intermediate results saving
- Removed delay between resume processing
- Structured the code with proper functions and main entry point
- Backed up the original script in the Results/backup directory

### 3. Results Directory Cleanup
- Removed all timestamp-specific result files
- Eliminated performance reports and metrics files
- Kept only `resume_analysis_results.csv` as the main output
- Maintained the cvinsight.log file for debugging
- Moved all other files to a backup folder

### 4. Final Testing
- Verified the new script works correctly with a small subset of resumes
- Confirmed the CSV output contains all necessary information
- Tested with both `--limit` and `--all` flags

## Using the Cleaned System

To run the resume parsing system:

```bash
# Process all resumes
python run_resumes.py --all

# Process a limited number of resumes
python run_resumes.py --limit 5
```

The results will be saved to `Results/resume_analysis_results.csv` with no additional files created.
